## Chapter 1
### Definition
Governance in general refers to when an entity observes control and direction of the overall area of interest for them, typically taking the form of how decisions are formulated, regulated and executed. 

The formality and structure that governance takes depend on context and intent.

The discipline in which an organization acts in recognition of the value of its information assets
is called enterprise information management (EIM). Governing and managing data well is a central enabler of EIM, which also includes using technologies and processes to elevate data to be a shared enterprise asset.

### Diff between Data Governance and Data Management
Data governance is focused on **roles** and **responsibilities**, **policies**, **definitions**, **metrics**, and the **lifecycle** of data.

Data management is the technical implementation of data governance. Think Databases, Application Programming Interfaces (API's), analytics softwares, etc.
