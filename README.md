# Data_Governance
## Chapter 1
### Definition
Governance in general refers to when an entity observes control and direction of the overall area of interest for them, typically taking the form of how decisions are formulated, regulated and executed. 

The formality and structure that governance takes depend on context and intent.

Data Governance Framework:
- Discovery
- Classification
- Policy
- Rules
- Metadata

The discipline in which an organization acts in recognition of the value of its information assets
is called enterprise information management (EIM). Governing and managing data well is a central enabler of EIM, which also includes using technologies and processes to elevate data to be a shared enterprise asset.

### Diff between Data Governance and Data Management
Data governance is focused on **roles** and **responsibilities**, **policies**, **definitions**, **metrics**, and the **lifecycle** of data.

Data management is the technical implementation of data governance. Think Databases, Application Programming Interfaces (API's), analytics softwares, etc.

Information governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organization, customers, and other stakeholders.

Data Governance Framework Notes:
Your data governance program must be aligned with the strategy of the organization.

Every data governance framework includes the identification and assignment of specific roles and responsibilities, which range from the information technology (IT) team to data stewards.

Capturing metrics and delivering them to a variety of stakeholders is important for maintaining support, which includes funding. Overal Improvements can be made based on Metrics in order to ensure that the program is producing value.

Tools for data governance frameworkinclude master data management, data catalogs, search, security, integration, analytics, and compliance.


On a basic level, data culture is how your organization values data and how it manages and uses it.
decisions are based on data and the insights they can produce.

### Maturing the Data Culture
- Assist leaders to elaborate the importance of data and create an environment where Data is priority by, for instance, showing the positive outcomes of prioritizing data.

- Provide the basic tools and educate stakeholders on how to manage and manipulate data.

- Create a mock-up of the progress that a Mature Data Culture could have.

-  Provide a feedback channel for reviews from employees
