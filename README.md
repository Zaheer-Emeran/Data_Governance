# Data_Governance
## Chapter 1
### Definition
Governance in general refers to when an entity observes control and direction of the overall area of interest for them, typically taking the form of how decisions are formulated, regulated and executed. 

The formality and structure that governance takes depend on context and intent.

Data Governance Cycle:
- Discovery
- Classification
- Policy
- Rules
- Metadata

The discipline in which an organization acts in recognition of the value of its information assets
is called enterprise information management (EIM). Governing and managing data well is a central enabler of EIM, which also includes using technologies and processes to elevate data to be a shared enterprise asset.

### Diff between Data Governance and Data Management
Data governance is focused on **roles** and **responsibilities**, **policies**, **definitions**, **metrics**, and the **lifecycle** of data.

Data management is the technical implementation of data governance. Think Databases, Application Programming Interfaces (API's), analytics softwares, etc.

### Diff Between Data Governance and Information Governance
Information governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organization, customers, and other stakeholders.

Data Governance just refers to the governance of data.
