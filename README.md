Data Governance Framework Notes:
Your data governance program must be aligned with the strategy of the organization.

Every data governance framework includes the identification and assignment of specific roles and responsibilities, which range from the information technology (IT) team to data stewards.

Capturing metrics and delivering them to a variety of stakeholders is important for maintaining support, which includes funding. Overal Improvements can be made based on Metrics in order to ensure that the program is producing value.

Tools for data governance frameworkinclude master data management, data catalogs, search, security, integration, analytics, and compliance.


On a basic level, data culture is how your organization values data and how it manages and uses it.
decisions are based on data and the insights they can produce.

### Maturing the Data Culture
- Assist leaders to elaborate the importance of data and create an environment where Data is priority by, for instance, showing the positive outcomes of prioritizing data.

- Provide the basic tools and educate stakeholders on how to manage and manipulate data.

- Create a mock-up of the progress that a Mature Data Culture could have.
